\chapter{Lay Abstract}\label{lay_abstract}

Testing software is important to ensure that it achieves its goals and works as
intended. However, the documents that describe how to perform testing have many
mistakes, making testing harder and less consistent. By looking through the
literature, we find \approachCount{} different ways to perform testing. We also
record how these methods are defined and the relations they have with each
other. After collecting and analyzing all these data, we find \flawCount{}
flaws, such as missing definitions or relations that contradict each other.
This shows that despite the amount of information available about software
testing, there are significant improvements to be made that would make testing
software less confusing and more consistent.
