\chapter{Lay Abstract}\label{lay_abstract}

It is important to test software to ensure that it achieves its goals and works as
intended. However, the documents that describe how to perform testing have many
flaws, making this process more difficult and less consistent. By looking through
the literature, we found \approachCount{} different approaches to testing. We
record how these approaches are defined and the relations between them. After
collecting and analyzing all these data, we found \flawCount{}
flaws, such as missing definitions or relations that contradict each other.
This shows that despite the amount of information available about software
testing, there are significant improvements to be made that would make testing
software less confusing and more consistent.
