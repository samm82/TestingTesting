\chapter{Declaration of Academic Achievement}
\label{decl_aca_ach}

This research and analysis was performed by Samuel Crawford under the
guidance, supervision, and recommendations of \supers{}. The resulting
contributions are three glossaries---one for
each of test approaches, software qualities (see \Cref{qual-test}), and
supplementary terms---as well as the tools for data visualization and
automated analysis outlined in \Cref{tools}. These are all available on
\href{https://github.com/samm82/TestingTesting}{an open-source repo}
for independent analysis and, ideally, extension as more test approaches are
discovered and documented.
