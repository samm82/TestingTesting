\chapter{Declaration of Academic Achievement}\label{decl_aca_ach}

This research and analysis was performed by Samuel Crawford under the
guidance, supervision, and recommendations of \supers{}. The resulting
contributions are three glossaries---one for each of test approaches, software
qualities, and supplementary terms (see \Cref{record-info})---as well as the
tools for data visualization and
automated analysis outlined in \Cref{tools}. These are all available on
\href{https://github.com/samm82/TestingTesting}{an open-source repo}
for independent analysis and, ideally, extension as more test approaches are
discovered and documented.
