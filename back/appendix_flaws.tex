\chapter{Full Lists of Flaws}\label{flaws-full}

The following are the full lists of manually identified flaws, first grouped
by their manifestation, then by their domain as defined in \Cref{flaw-def}.

\subsection{Full List of Synonym Flaws}

\subsubsection{Intransitive Synonyms}\label{multiSyns}
There are also cases in which a term is given as a synonym to two (or more)
terms that are not synonyms themselves. Sometimes, these terms
\emph{are} synonyms; for example, \citetISTQB{} \multiAuthHelper{say}
``use case testing'', ``user scenario testing'', and ``scenario testing'' are
all synonyms (although there may be a slight distinction; see
\Cref{tab:parSyns} and \flawref{use-case-scenario}).
% Old explanation based on inconsistent citations from Kam2008/ISTQB
%
% use case testing, user scenario testing,
% and scenario testing are synonyms of each other, as shown in
% \Cref{fig:threeWaySyns}.

%         \draw[thick] (uct) -- (ust) node [midway, align=center, right=4pt] {\citealp[p.~48]{Kam2008}\\};

However, this does not always make sense. We identify \multiSynCount{}
such cases through automatic analysis of the generated graphs\ifnotpaper,
listed below (test approaches in \emph{italics} are synonyms with each other,
but not with other terms not in italics\todo{Better way to handle/display
    this?})\else. The following three are the most prominent examples\fi:

\begin{enumerate}
    \input{\ifnotpaper build\else assets/misc\fi/multiSyns}
\end{enumerate}
