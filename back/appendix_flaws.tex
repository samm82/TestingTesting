\chapter{Full Lists of Flaws}\label{flaws-full}

The following are the full lists of manually identified flaws, first grouped
by their manifestation (\Cref{flawMnfsts-full}), then by their domain
(\Cref{flawDmn-full}) as defined in \Cref{flaw-def}. We then present inferred
flaws (\Cref{infer-flaws}) as described in \Cref{infers} for completeness,
although these flaws do not contribute to any counts.
% since they require further analysis to determine if they are flaws at all!

\section{Full Lists of Flaws by Manifestation}\label{flawMnfsts-full}

We sort the following groups of flaws by their source tier (defined in
\Cref{source-tiers}) in descending order of credibility (defined in
\Cref{cred}).

\subsection{Full List of Mistakes}\label{wrong-full}
\input{build/FlawMnfstWrong}

\subsection{Full List of Omissions}\label{miss-full}
\input{build/FlawMnfstMiss}

\subsection{Full List of Contradictions}\label{contra-full}
\input{build/FlawMnfstContra}

\subsection{Full List of Ambiguities}\label{ambi-full}
\input{build/FlawMnfstAmbi}

\subsection{Full List of Overlaps}\label{over-full}
\input{build/FlawMnfstOver}

\subsection{Full List of Redundancies}\label{redun-full}
\input{build/FlawMnfstRedun}

\section{Full Lists of Flaws by Domain}\label{flawDmn-full}

The following sections provide all of the data that we automatically detect
(as described in \Cref{auto-flaw-analysis}) and summarize in \Cref{flawDmns}.

\subsection{Multiple Categorizations}\label{multiCats-full}

As mentioned in \Cref{multiCats}, \multiCatIntro{} and list them in
\Cref{tab:multiCats}.

\subsection{Intransitive Synonyms}\label{multiSyns}
There are also cases in which a term is given as a synonym to two (or more)
terms that are not synonyms themselves. Sometimes, these terms
\emph{are} synonyms; for example, \citetISTQB{} \multiAuthHelper{say}
``use case testing'', ``user scenario testing'', and ``scenario testing'' are
all synonyms (although there may be a slight distinction; see
\Cref{tab:parSyns} and \flawref{use-case-scenario}).
% Old explanation based on inconsistent citations from Kam2008/ISTQB
%
% use case testing, user scenario testing,
% and scenario testing are synonyms of each other, as shown in
% \Cref{fig:threeWaySyns}.

%         \node[ellipse, draw, align=center] (st)  at (0, 0)  {Scenario\\Testing};
%         \node[ellipse, draw, align=center] (uct) at (5, 4)  {Use Case\\Testing};
%
%         \draw[thick] (ust) -- (st)  node [midway, align=center, below]     {\citealpISTQB{}};
%         \draw[thick] (st)  -- (uct) node [midway, align=center, left=12pt] {\citealpISTQB{};\\ \citealp[pp.~47--49]{Kam2008}\\ (see \flawref{use-case-scenario})\\};
%         \draw[thick] (uct) -- (ust) node [midway, align=center, right=4pt] {\citealp[p.~48]{Kam2008}\\};
%
%     \end{tikzpicture}

However, this does not always make sense. We identify \multiSynCount{}
such cases through automatic analysis of the generated graphs\ifnotpaper,
listed below (test approaches in \emph{italics} are synonyms with each other,
but not with other terms not in italics\todo{Better way to handle/display
    this?})\else. The following three are the most prominent examples\fi:

\begin{enumerate}
    \input{\ifnotpaper build\else assets/misc\fi/multiSyns}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Synonym and Parent-Child Overlaps}\label{parSyns-full}
As described in \Cref{parSyns}, \parSynIntro*{}.

\section{Inferred Flaws}\label{infer-flaws}
Throughout our research, we infer many potential flaws as described in
\Cref{infers}. Some of these have a conflicting source while others do not.
Since these are more subjective and are based on our own judgement, we
exclude them from any counts of the numbers of flaws but give them here for
completeness.

\subsection{Inferred Synonym Flaws}\label{infMultiSyns}
See \Cref{multiSyns}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \input{build/infMultiSyns}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Inferred Parent Flaws}\label{infParSyns}
As discussed in \Cref{parSyns}, some pairs of synonyms also have a
parent-child relation, abusing the meaning of ``synonym'' and causing
confusion. While \Cref{tab:parSyns} gives the cases where both relations
are supported by the literature, some are less explicit. The
following automatically generated lists contain examples where at least
one of these conflicting relations is \emph{not} explicitly supported by the
literature but may, nonetheless, be correct. The relations in the first two
lists are explicitly given in the literature but may be incorrect, while
those in the third list are unsubtantiated by the literature and require
more thought before a recommendation can be made.

\input{build/infParSyns}

In addition to this type of flaw, \citep[Tab.~2]{Gerrard2000a} does
\emph{not} give ``functionality testing'' as a parent of ``end-to-end
functionality testing''. Finally, \citet[p.~119]{Patton2006} says that
branch testing is ``the simplest form of path testing'' which is also
implied by \citet[Fig.~F.1]{IEEE2021c}\todo{OG Reid, 1996} and
\citet[p.~433]{vanVliet2000}. This is true in the example
\citeauthor{Patton2006} gives, but is not necessarily generalizable; one
could test the behaviour at branches without testing even a \emph{subset}
of complete paths, which \citet[p.~316]{IEEE2017} give as a definition of
``path testing'' (see \flawref{path-test})!

\subsection{Inferred Category Flaws}
See \Cref{multiCats}.

\input{build/infMultiCats}

\subsection{Other Inferred Flaws}
The following are flaws that, if were more concrete, would also be
included alongside the other flaws:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``Fuzz testing'' is ``tagged'' (?) as ``artificial
          intelligence'' \citep[p.~5]{IEEE2022}.
    \item \citeauthor{Gerrard2000b}'s definition for ``security
          audits'' seems too specific, only applying to ``the products
          installed on a site'' and ``the known vulnerabilities for
          those products'' \citeyearpar[p.~28]{Gerrard2000b}.
\end{itemize}
