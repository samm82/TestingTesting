\chapter{Full Lists of Flaws}\label{flaws-full}

The following are the full lists of manually identified flaws, first grouped
by their manifestation (\Cref{flawMnfsts-full}), then by their domain
(\Cref{flawDmn-full}) as defined in \Cref{flaw-def}. We then present inferred
flaws (\Cref{infer-flaws}) as described in \Cref{infers} for completeness,
although these flaws do not contribute to any counts.
% since they require further analysis to determine if they are flaws at all!

\section{Full Lists of Flaws by Manifestation}\label{flawMnfsts-full}

We sort the following groups of flaws by their source tier (defined in
\Cref{source-tiers}) in descending order of credibility (defined in
\Cref{cred}).

    \section{Full Lists of Flaws by Domain}\label{flawDmn-full}

    The following sections provide all of the data that we automatically detect
    (as described in \Cref{auto-flaw-detect}) and summarize in \Cref{flawDmns}.

    \subsection{Multiple Categorizations}\label{multiCats-full}

    As mentioned in \Cref{multiCats}, \multiCatIntro{} and list them in
    \Cref{tab:multiCats}.

    \input{build/multiCats}
\end{landscape}

\subsection{Intransitive Synonyms}\label{multiSyns}
As described in \Cref{relevantSyns}, intransitive synonyms are examples of
flaws since they violate our definition of the synonym relation in
\Cref{syn-rels}. We identify \multiSynCount{}
such cases through automatic analysis of generated visualizations\ifnotpaper,
listed below (test approaches in \emph{italics} are synonyms with each other,
but not with other terms not in italics\todo{Better way to handle/display
    this?})\else. The following three are the most prominent examples\fi:

\begin{enumerate}
    \input{\ifnotpaper build\else assets/misc\fi/multiSyns}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Synonym and Parent-Child Overlaps}\label{parSyns-full}
As described in \Cref{parSyns}, \parSynIntro*{}.

\section{Inferred Flaws}\label{infer-flaws}
Throughout our research, we infer many potential flaws as described in
\Cref{infers}. Some of these have a conflicting source while others do not.
Since these are more subjective and are based on our own judgement, we
exclude them from any counts of the numbers of flaws but give them here for
completeness.

\subsection{Inferred Multiple Categorizations}\label{infMultiCats}
As mentioned in \Cref{multiCats}, \multiCatIntro{}. This includes those with
categories that we infer based on our assumption that child approaches
inherit their parents' categories (as described in \Cref{infers}). We list
these approaches and their given and inferred categories (along with their
relevant parent in parentheses) in \Cref{tab:infMultiCats}.

\input{build/infMultiCats}

\subsection{Inferred Intransitive Synonyms}\label{infMultiSyns}
In addition to the \multiSynCount{} cases of intransitive synonyms we list in
\Cref{multiCats-full}, we infer some synonym relations based on the terms'
definitions that create the following inferred flaws (some pairs of synonyms
have sources; those that do not are ones we infer):

\begin{enumerate}
    \input{build/infMultiSyns}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Inferred Parent Flaws}\label{infParSyns}
As discussed in \Cref{parSyns}, some pairs of synonyms also have a
parent-child relation, abusing the meaning of ``synonym'' and causing
confusion. While \Cref{tab:parSyns} gives the cases where both relations
are supported by the literature, some are less explicit. The
following automatically generated lists contain examples where at least
one of these conflicting relations is \emph{not} explicitly supported by the
literature but may, nonetheless, be correct. The relations in the first two
lists are explicitly given in the literature but may be incorrect, while
those in the third list are unsubtantiated by the literature and require
more thought before a recommendation can be made.

\input{build/infParSyns}

In addition to these flaws, \citep[Tab.~2]{Gerrard2000a} does
\emph{not} give ``functionality testing'' as a parent of ``end-to-end
functionality testing'' as we infer he should (see \Cref{orth-test}).
