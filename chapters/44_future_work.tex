\section{Future Work}\label{future-work}

Ideally, our work would have resulted in a complete taxonomy of software
testing terminology based on the literature. Unfortunately, we were not able to
fully accomplish this due to time constraints. With more time, we would
continue iterating over undefined terms (\Cref{future-undef-terms}) and
investigate terms we \emph{expected} to find but never did
(\Cref{future-miss-terms}). Additionally, there is much more work we could do
to analyze our data on the software testing literature, such as detecting
more classes of flaws (and identifying them!) (\Cref{future-detect-flaws}).
