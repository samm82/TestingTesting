          testing'' with all its related information should be used instead.

          While \citet[p.~120]{Patton2006} implies that condition testing is a
          subtechnique of path testing, \citet[Fig.~13.17]{vanVliet2000} says
          that multiple condition coverage (which seems to be a synonym of
          condition coverage \citetext{p.~422}) does not subsume and is not
          subsumed by path coverage.
