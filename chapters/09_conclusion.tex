\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

While a good starting point, software testing literature has many areas for
improvement. As is, it contains many flaws that create unnecessary barriers to
testing software. While there is merit to allowing the state-of-the-practice
terminology to descriptively guide how terminology is used, standardizing these
conventions gives a common ground for software testers to use or adopt as
appropriate for their needs. This \docType{} exposes how unstandardized
software testing terminology is by outlining the flaws we find in the
literature.

Future work in this
area will continue to investigate the current use of terminology, in
particular \nameref{undef-terms}, determine if IEEE's current
\nameref{cats-def} are sufficient, and rationalize the definitions of
and relations between terms.
