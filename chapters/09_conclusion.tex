While a good starting point, the current literature on software testing has
much room to grow. The many flaws create unnecessary barriers to
software testing. While there is merit to allowing the state-of-the-practice
terminology to descriptively guide how terminology is used, there
may be a need to prescriptively structure terminology to intentionally
differentiate between and organize various test approaches. Future work in this
area will continue to investigate the current use of terminology, in
particular \nameref{undef-terms}, determine if IEEE's current
\nameref{cats-def} are sufficient, and rationalize the definitions of
and relations between terms.
