\ifnotpaper
    To better understand our findings, we build tools to more intuitively
    visualize relations between test approaches (\Cref{app-rel-vis}) and
    automatically track their flaws (\Cref{flaw-analysis}). Doing
    this manually would be error-prone due to the amount of data involved (for
    example, we identify \approachCount{} test approaches) and the number of
    situations where the underlying data would change, including more detailed
    analysis, error corrections, and the addition of data. These all require
    tedious updates to the corresponding graphs that may be overlooked or done
    incorrectly, so automating these processes allows for our results to be
    reproduced (by us or others) and account for new data. Besides being more
    systematic, this also allows us to observe the impacts of smaller changes,
    such as unexpected flaws that arise from a new relation between two
    approaches. It also helps verify the tools themselves; for example,
    tracking a flaw manually should affect relevant flaw counts, which we can
    double-check. We also define \LaTeX{} macros to help achieve our goals of
    maintainability, traceability, and reproducibility (\Cref{macros}).

    \subsection{Approach Relation Visualization}\label{app-rel-vis}
\fi

To better visualize how test approaches relate to each other, we
develop a tool to automatically generate visualizations of these relations.
\ifnotpaper
    % We can describe these graphs formally as ordered triplets
    %     $G = (A, S, P)$, where:  % Format based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory
    %     \begin{itemize}
    %         \item $T$ is the set of terms assigned to test approaches by the
    %               literature,
    %         \item $A \subseteq T$ is a subset of the \approachCount{} test
    %               approaches we record as rows in \ourApproachGlossary{} that
    %               function as the vertices of the graph,
    %         \item $S \subseteq \left\{ \{x, y\} \mid x, y \in T \,\textrm{ and }\,
    %                   (x \in A \,\textrm{ or }\, y \in A) \,\textrm{ and }\, x \neq y \right\}$
    %               is a subset of our identified synonym relations (defined
    %               in \Cref{syn-rels}) that function as edges, and
    %         \item $P \subseteq \left\{(x,y) \mid (x, y) \in A^2 \right\}$ is a
    %               subset of our identified parent-child relations (defined in
    %               \Cref{par-chd-rels}) that also function as edges.
    %     \end{itemize}
    Since we use a consistent format to track synonym and parent-child
    relations (see \Cref{syn-rels,par-chd-rels}, respectively)
    between approaches in \ourApproachGlossary{}, we can parse them
    systematically. For example, if the entries in \Cref{tab:exampleGlossary}
    appear in the glossary, then their parent-child relations are displayed as
    \Cref{fig:exampleGraph} in the generated graph. We also capture relevant
    citation information in our glossary in the author-year citation format,
    ``reusing'' information from previous citations when applicable.
    For example, the first row of \Cref{tab:exampleGlossary}
    contains the citation ``(Author, 0000; 0001)'', which means that this
    information was present in two documents by Author: one written in
    the year 0000, and one in 0001. The following citation, ``(0000)'',
    contains no author, which means it was written by the same one as the
    previous citation (Author). We process these citations according to this
    logic \seeSrcCode{f173e88}{scripts/csvToGraph.py}{55}{96} so we can
    consistently track them throughout our analysis. We also colour each
    relation according to its source tier (see \Cref{source-tiers}), including
    inferences (see \Cref{infers}) and proposals (see \Cref{recs}), but only
    display the relation with the most credible source tier (see \Cref{cred}).
    Although we omit this colouring from \Cref{fig:exampleParChdGraphs,%
        fig:exampleSynGraph,fig:exampleFlawGraphs} for brevity%,
    % \Cref{fig:expSynGraph} shows how
    % this affects our visualizations; each line representing a synonym relation
    % is coloured based on the most credible source that describes that relation
    .

\phantomsection{}\label{relevantSyns}
We graph all parent-child relations, since they are guaranteed to be visually
meaningful.
% , but only graph some synonym relations.
% For a given synonym pair to
% be captured by our methodology, at least one term will have its own row in its
% relevant glossary.
However, since each term is trivially a synonym of itself and there are many
non-problematic synonyms that do not imply flaws (see \Cref{syn-rels}),
we only visualize the following synonym relations, which may indicate flaws:

% We then decide whether to include or exclude the synonym
% pair from our generated graphs based on the following possible cases:
\begin{enumerate}
    % \item[1. (Excluded)] \phantomsection{}\label{syn-case-one}
    %       \hfill \ifnotpaper
    %           $\left\{ \{x, y\} \in S \mid x \in A \,\textrm{ xor }\, y \in A \right\}$
    %       \fi \break
    %       \textbf{Only one synonym has its own row.}
    %       This is a ``typical'' synonym relation (see \Cref{syn-rels}) where
    %       the terms are interchangeable. We \emph{could} include the synonym
    %       as an alternate name inside the node of its partner, but we do not
    %       want to clutter our graphs unnecessarily.

    \item%[2. (Included)] \phantomsection{}\label{syn-case-two}
          %   \hfill \ifnotpaper
          %       $\left\{ \{x, y\} \in S \mid x, y \in A \right\}$
          %   \fi \break
          \textbf{Synonyms between approaches defined independently.}\hfill\break
          If two separate approaches have their own definitions, nuances,
          etc.~but are also labelled as synonyms, this may indicate that the
          two terms are interchangeable and could be merged \emph{or} that
          either their definitions or this synonym relation is incorrect.
          % TODO: pretty hacky
          % into one row, which would result in \hyperref[syn-case-one]{Case 1} above.

    \item%[3. (Included)] \phantomsection{}\label{syn-case-three}
          %   \hfill \ifnotpaper
          %       $\left\{ \{x, z\}, \{y, z\} \in S \mid x, y \in A \,\textrm{ and }\,
          %           z \notin A \right\}$
          %   \fi \break
          \textbf{Synonyms that violate transitivity.}\hfill\break
          If two distinct approaches share a synonym, that implies that they
          are synonyms themselves. If they are \emph{not}, one or more
          relations may be incorrect or missing.
\end{enumerate}
\ifnotpaper
    We deduce these conditions from the information we parse from our
    glossary. For example, if the entries in \Cref{tab:synExampleGlossary}
    appear in the glossary, then they are displayed as \Cref{fig:exampleSynGraph}
    in the generated graph (note that we do not include X in our visualization
    since it does not have its own row in the glossary and is not shared
    between multiple approaches that do).

    % Applying this technique to \ourApproachGlossary{} (and manually modifying
    % it for legibility) results in \Cref{fig:expSynGraph} (note that we exclude
    % implicit synonyms from this visualization, but we include them in others).
    % These relations are given as described by the literature and are therefore
    % flawed. In particular, we later discuss synonyms that violate transitivity
    % (as described earlier) in \Cref{multiSyns} and other kinds of flawed
    % synonym relations in \Cref{parSyns,func-test-flaw,scal-flaw,compat-flaw}.

    \phantomsection{}\label{graphExplicit}
    Since we also track the ``explicitness'' of information
    (see \Cref{explicitness}), we can represent explicit
    \emph{and} implicit relations without double counting them during the
    analysis in \Cref{flaw-analysis}. If a relation is both explicit
    \emph{and} implicit, we only include the implicit relation in the graph
    if its source is more ``credible'' (see \Cref{cred}).%
    \qtodo{Do I need an example of this?}
    % For example, only the explicit synonym relation between E and F
    % from \Cref{tab:exampleGlossary} appears in \Cref{fig:synExampleGraph}.
    Implicit approaches and relations are denoted by dashed lines, as shown
    in \Cref{fig:exampleGraph}; explicit approaches are % fig:synExampleGraph
    \emph{always} denoted by solid lines, even if they are also implicit.
    We can also generate ``explicit'' versions of these graphs that exclude
    implicit approaches and relations; for example, \Cref{fig:expExampleGraph}
    is the explicit version of \Cref{fig:exampleGraph}%, and
    % \Cref{fig:expSynGraph} likewise only contains explicit approaches and
    % synonym relations
    .

\fi
Since these graphs tend to be large, it is useful to focus on specific
subsets of them. \ifnotpaper For each approach category (see
    \Cref{cats-def}), we generate a graph restricted to its approaches
    and the relations between them. We also generate a graph of all static
    approaches along with the relations between them \emph{and} between a
    static approach and a dynamic approach. We generate this static-focused
    graph because static testing is sometimes considered to be a separate
    approach category (see \flawref{static-test-flaw}), but we include the
    relations with dynamic approaches since they are our primary focus
    (see \Cref{static-test}). We colour all dynamic approach nodes in these
    graphs grey
    %, as in \Cref{fig:staticExampleGraph}, 
    to distinguish them%
    %, and include this in the legend of \Cref{fig:exampleGraphs} for convenience
    .\qtodo{Since this doesn't come up in our thesis, do I even need an example?}
    % If we assume that the approaches in \Crefrange{fig:exampleGraph}
    % {fig:parSynExampleGraph} are all static, then this portion of the legend
    % applies to the entirety of \Cref{fig:exampleGraphs}; otherwise, it only
    % applies to \Cref{fig:staticExampleGraph}.\qtodo{Does this make sense?}

    We can also generate more specific subsets of these graphs
\else We can generate more focused graphs \fi from a given subset of
approaches, such as \ifnotpaper\else those in a selected approach category
    (see \Cref{cats-def}) or \fi those pertaining to recovery or
scalability\ifnotpaper.
% These areas are of particular note as we discuss their
% flaws in their own sections (\Cref{recov-flaw,scal-flaw}, respectively).
We generate graphs of just these subsets of software testing to help visualize
the relations between these approaches, but we can also update them based on
our recommendations by specifying sets of approaches and relations to add or
remove. % given \else; the latter are shown \fi
% in \Cref{fig:rec-graph-current,fig:scal-graph-current}, respectively.
% applying those given in \Cref{rec-test-rec,,scal-test-rec,,\ifnotpaper\else%
%         perf-test-rec\fi} results in the updated graphs in
% \Cref{fig:rec-graph-proposed,,fig:scal-graph-proposed,,\ifnotpaper\else%
%         fig:perf-graph\fi}, respectively.
When doing so, we colour any added approaches or relations orange to
distinguish them. % \ifnotpaper
% Recommendations can also be inherited; for example, we generate
% \Cref{fig:perf-graph} based on the modifications we apply to
% \Cref{fig:rec-graph-proposed,fig:scal-graph-proposed} and
% other changes from \Cref{perf-test-rec}. \fi
