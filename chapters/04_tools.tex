    To better understand our findings, we build tools to
    visualize relations between test approaches (\Cref{app-rel-vis}) and
    automatically analyze their flaws (\Cref{flaw-analysis}). (We support this
    by using consistent syntax for recording data, which we outline in
    \Cref{tools-guide} to balance completeness and brevity.) Doing
    this manually would be daunting and error-prone because of the amount of
    data involved (for example, we identified \approachCount{} test approaches).
    There are also many situations where the underlying data would change, such
    as adding to it, further analyzing it, or correcting it. % These all require
    % tedious updates to the corresponding visualizations that may be overlooked
    % or done incorrectly, so automating these processes allows for our results
    % to be reproduced (by us or others) and account for new data.
    % Besides being more systematic, automation also allows us to observe the
    % impacts of smaller changes, such as unexpected flaws that arise from a
    % new relation between two approaches. It also helps us verify the tools
    % themselves; for example, tracking a flaw manually should affect relevant
    % flaw counts, which we can double-check.
    We also define \LaTeX{} macros (\Cref{macros}) to help achieve our
    goals of maintainability, traceability, and reproducibility.

We develop a tool to visualize the relations between test approaches so we can
better understand them. \ifnotpaper This is possible because of our systematic
    tracking of synonym and parent-child relations (defined in
    \Cref{syn-rels,par-chd-rels}, respectively) in \ourApproachGlossary{}
    (see \Cref{citation-syntax}). For example, if the entries in
    \Cref{tab:exampleGlossary} appear, then their parent-child relations are
    visualized as shown in \Cref{fig:exampleGraph}. Overall, the parent-child
    relations between test approaches \emph{should} result in something
    resembling a hierarchy (or multiple discrete hierarchies), although this is
    not the case because of flaws in the literature (see \Cref{selfParDef}). We
    therefore visualize all parent-child relations as significant.

    However, since each term is trivially a synonym of itself and there are many
    non-problematic synonyms that do not imply flaws (see \Cref{syn-rels}),
    we only visualize the synonym relations that may indicate flaws given in
    \Cref{relevantSyns}; i.e., intransitive synonyms and synonyms between
    independently defined approaches. \phantomsection{}\label{syn-conds}%
    We deduce these conditions from the information in our glossary;
    for example, if the entries in \Cref{tab:synExampleGlossary} appear, then
    we visualize them as shown in \Cref{fig:exampleSynGraph} (note that
    approach ``X'' does not appear since it does not have its own definition or
    violate transitivity). If a test approach does not have one of
    these relations \emph{or} a parent-child relation, we call it an ``orphan''
    approach (in contrast to the ``parent'' and ``child'' approaches defined in
    \Cref{par-chd-rels}) and exclude it from any visualizations in which it
    would otherwise appear.

    \phantomsection{}\label{visExplicit}
    We also visualize the ``explicitness'' of information (defined in
    \Cref{explicitness}) by representing implicit approaches and relations
    with dashed lines (see \Cref{fig:exampleGraph,fig:exampleSynGraph}).
    If a relation is both explicit \emph{and} implicit, we only display the
    latter if its source tier is more credible than the former's (see
    \Cref{cred,source-tiers}). For example, if
    ``StdAuthor'' from \Cref{tab:synExampleGlossary} is the author of a
    standard, then we display the implicit relation from their
    document alongside the explicit one from ``Author'' as shown in
    \Cref{fig:exampleSynGraph}.
    % For example, only the explicit synonym relation between E and F
    % from \Cref{tab:exampleGlossary} appears in \Cref{fig:synExampleGraph}.
    Explicit approaches
    \emph{always} have solid lines, even if they are also implicit. We
    can also omit implicit approaches and relations from visualizations; for
    example, \Cref{fig:expExampleGraph} is the explicit version of
    \Cref{fig:exampleGraph}. %, and \Cref{fig:expSynGraph} likewise only
    % contains explicit approaches and synonym relations

    Since we cite all recorded relations as described in
    \Cref{citation-syntax}, we can also colour each relation according to its
    source tier. Each source tier gets its own colour, which we label
    for each relevant source tier in a given visualization's legend
    (such as \Cref{fig:exampleSynGraph}), although we omit this
    colouring from \Cref{fig:exampleParChdGraphs,fig:exampleFlawGraphs} for
    clarity. We also only display the relation with the most credible source
    tier (except if there is a more credible implicit relation as we previously
    describe). Finally, we also colour inferences (see \Cref{infers}) grey and
    proposals (see \Cref{app-recs}) orange, such as in \recFigs{}.

These visualizations tend to be large, so it is often useful to focus on
specific subsets of them. \ifnotpaper For each approach category (defined in
    \Cref{cats-def}), we generate a visualization restricted to its approaches
    and the relations between them. We also generate a visualization of all static
    approaches along with the relations between them \emph{and} between a
    static approach and a dynamic approach. This static-focused visualization is
    notable because static testing is sometimes considered to be a separate
    approach category (see \flawref{static-test-flaw}). Since dynamic
    approaches are our primary focus (see \Cref{static-test}), we include them
    in this static visualization, colouring their nodes grey to distinguish them.
