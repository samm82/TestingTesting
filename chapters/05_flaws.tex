\section{Observed Flaws}\label{flaws}

% Moved earlier to display nicely in paper
% \flawMnfstsTable{}
% \flawDmnsTable{}

After gathering all these data\footnote{Available in \texttt{ApproachGlossary.csv},
    \texttt{QualityGlossary.csv}, and \texttt{SuppGlossary.csv} at \ifblind{
        [Repository link suppressed]}{
        \url{https://github.com/samm82/TestingTesting}}.}, we found \flawCount{}
flaws. \Cref{fig:flawBars} shows where these flaws appear within each source tier
(defined in \Cref{source-tiers}) which reveals the following about software
testing literature: \srcTierObservs{}

To better understand and analyze these flaws, we group them by their
manifestations and their domains as defined in \Cref{flaw-def}.
We present the total number of flaws by manifestation and by domain
in \Cref{tab:flawMnfsts,tab:flawDmns}, respectively, where a given
row corresponds to the number of flaws either within that source tier and/or
with a more credible one (i.e., a previous row in the table). We also group
these flaws by their explicitness
(defined in \Cref{explicitness}) by counting (Obj)ective and (Sub)jective flaws
separately, since additional context may rectify them.
Since we give each flaw a manifestation \emph{and} a domain, the totals per
source and grand totals in these tables are equal.
\ifnotpaper
    We also summarize how many flaws appear in each source tier in
    \Cref{fig:flawBarsSummary} (note that these values align with the totals in
    \Cref{tab:flawMnfsts,tab:flawDmns}) and normalize these totals to the
    number of documents in each tier in \Cref{fig:normFlawBarsSummary}.

    \end{landscape}

    \input{assets/graphs/flawBarsSummary}
    As shown in \Cref{fig:flawBarsSummary}, each source tier contains a
    comparable number of flaws, although
    this changes drastically when normalizing these totals by the number of
    documents in each source tier in \Cref{fig:normFlawBarsSummary}. Since some
    terminology collections are glossaries or taxonomies of terms, they
    contain a much larger proportion of relevant information that we critique.
    Conversely, standards and papers contain lots of content we do \emph{not}
    investigate for scope reasons and time constraints, likely causing the
    relatively low numbers of flaws per document in these tiers. Textbooks lie
    somewhere in the middle, since we investigate them to varying degrees
    of thoroughness: the whole book, a specific chapter, and so on.

\fi
From these tables\ifnotpaper\ and figures\fi, we can draw some conclusions
about \emph{how} the literature is flawed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \contraSummary{}
    \item \catsSummary{}
    \item \semFlaws{}
\end{enumerate}

We summarize the flaws that we discover manually
% \ifnotpaper (see \Cref{flaw-comment-analysis}) \fi
in \Cref{flawMnfsts} based on their manifestation% (defined in \Cref{mnfst-def})
. This lets us separately summarize the flaws we automatically detect
\ifnotpaper (see \Cref{auto-flaw-detect}) \fi based on their domain %(defined in \Cref{dmn-def})
in \Cref{flawDmns}. \ifnotpaper We list \emph{all} these flaws in
    \Cref{flaws-full} to balance completeness and brevity, indicating implicit
    relations with the phrase ``implied by'' in \Cref{tab:parSyns,tab:multiCats,%
        tab:infMultiCats} as described in \Cref{explicitness}. \fi
Moreover, certain ``subsets'' of testing contain many interconnected flaws
which we present in \Cref{flawSubsets} as a ``third view'' to keep related
information together. The counts of flaws given in
\Cref{tab:flawMnfsts,tab:flawDmns} are essentially the sums of the flaws we
describe in the following subsections\ifnotpaper. Finally, we
infer some flaws as described in \Cref{infers}, which do not contribute to
any counts because they are subjective; we list these in \Cref{infer-flaws}
for completeness\else, although we omit the more trivial subsets from
\Cref{flawSubsets} for brevity\fi.

Due to time constraints, this collection of flaws is still not
comprehensive! While we apply our heuristics for identifying relevant terms
(see \Cref{ident-terms}) to the entirety of most investigated sources,
especially established standards (see \Cref{stds}), we were only able to
investigate some sources in part. These mainly comprise of sources chosen for a
specific area of interest or based on a test approach that was later determined
to be out-of-scope. These include the following sources\ifnotpaper\ as described
    in \Cref{future-undef-terms}\fi: \citet{ISO2022,ISO2015,Dominguez-PumarEtAl2020,
    PierreEtAl2017,TrudnowskiEtAl2017,YuEtAl2011,Tsui2007,Goralski1999}.%
\phantomsection{}\label{swebok-update}
Since our research began, the draft version of the \acs{swebok} v4.0
\citep{SWEBOK2024} has been updated and published \citeyearpar{SWEBOK2025};
we revisited this version to see which flaws in the draft were resolved (and found
two notable cases of this) following our heuristics based on these subsets, but
lacked the time to investigate this new version in full. Finally, some heuristics
only arose as research progressed, particularly those for deriving test
approaches (see \Cref{implied-approaches}); % (see \Cref{derived-tests})
while reiterating over investigated sources would be ideal, this is infeasible
due to time constraints.

From this partial implementation of our methodology, we identified
\approachCount{} test approaches, \undefPerc\% of which are undefined.
With more time, we would continue to snowball on these undefined terms
following the procedure in \Cref{undef-terms}\ifnotpaper\ (see
    \Cref{future-undef-terms} for more detailed discussion on what we
    accomplished)\fi.
Likewise, we were unable to reach our stopping criteria outlined in
\Cref{stop-crit}. We considered the discovery of property-based testing as an
alternate stopping point for our research\thesisissuenote{57,81,88,125}
since we are surprised that it is not mentioned in any sources we investigated.
Even so, we had to stop our snowballing approach before we discovered
property-based testing in the literature!\ifnotpaper\ With more time, we would
    uncover this along with other test approaches that did not arise (as
    described in \Cref{future-miss-terms}), but unfortunately, we imposed our
    stopping point artificially.\fi

\subsection{Flaws by Manifestation}\label{flawMnfsts}

The following sections list observed flaws grouped by \emph{how} they manifest
as presented in \Cref{mnfst-def}. These include mistakes (\Cref{wrong}),
omissions (\Cref{miss}), contradictions (\Cref{contra}), ambiguities
(\Cref{ambi}), overlaps (\Cref{over}), and redundancies (\Cref{redun}).

\subsubsection{Mistakes}\label{wrong}

There are many ways that information can be incorrect, which we identify in
\Cref{tab:brkdwnWrong}. We provide an example below for those that are less
straightforward\ifnotpaper; see \Cref{wrong-full} for the full list of
mistakes\fi.

\input{assets/tables/brkdwnWrong}

\paragraph{Information is incorrect based on an assertion from another source}
\qualImprovFlaw{}

\paragraph{Information is provided with an incorrect scope}
\parSheetTestFlaw{}

\paragraph{Incorrect information makes other information incorrect}
\redBoxFlaw{}

\subsubsection{Omissions}\label{miss}
We found four cases where a definition is omitted, two where a term is omitted
(along with its relations), one where a category is omitted, and one where a
citation is omitted\ifnotpaper; we list these in \Cref{miss-full}\fi.

\subsubsection{Contradictions}\label{contra}
There are many cases where multiple sources of information (sometimes within
the same document!) disagree. We found this happen with five categories, seven
synonym relations, seven parent-child relations, 17 definitions, and three
labels. \ifnotpaper These can be found in \Cref{contra-full}.\fi

\subsubsection{Ambiguities}\label{ambi}
Some information given in the literature is unclear; there is definitely
something ``wrong'', but we cannot deduce the intent of the original author(s).
We identify the kinds of ambiguous information given in \Cref{tab:brkdwnAmbi}%
\ifnotpaper; see \Cref{ambi-full} for the full list of ambiguities\fi.

\input{assets/tables/brkdwnAmbi}

\subsubsection{Overlaps}\label{over}
While information given in the literature should be atomic, this is not
always the case. We found four terms with multiple definitions, three terms
that share acronyms, and three definitions that overlap. \ifnotpaper We list
    these in \Cref{over-full}, grouping two of the terms with multiple
    definitions with a corresponding related flaw for brevity and clarity. \fi

\subsubsection{Redundancies}\label{redun}
We found redundancies in two parent-child relations, two definitions, and two
labels\ifnotpaper\ as listed in \Cref{redun-full}\fi.

\subsection{Flaws by Domain}\label{flawDmns}

The following sections present flaws that we detect automatically \ifnotpaper
    (see \Cref{auto-flaw-detect}) \fi grouped by \emph{what} information
is flawed as presented in \Cref{dmn-def}. We also provide more detailed
information for areas that may benefit from further
analysis. The domains we focus on here are test approach categories
(\Cref{cats}), synonym relations (\Cref{syns}), and parent-child relations
(\Cref{pars})%\ifnotpaper, and definitions (\Cref{defs})\fi
.

\subsubsection{Approach Category Flaws}\label{cats}

While the IEEE categorization of test approaches described in
\Cref{tab:ieeeCats} is useful, it is not without its faults. One issue,
which is not inherent to the categorization itself, is the fact that it is not
used consistently\ifnotpaper\ (see \Cref{tab:otherCats})\fi.
% Flaw count (CONTRA, CATS): {IEEE2017} | {IEEE2022}
The most blatant example of this is that \ifnotpaper \else \citeauthor{IEEE2017}
\fi \citet[p.~286]{IEEE2017} describe mutation testing as a
methodology, even though this is not one of the categories \emph{they} created!
% % Commented out for clarity; see #257
% Additionally, the boundaries between approaches within a category may
% be unclear: ``although each technique is defined independently of all others,
% in practice [sic] some can be used in combination with other techniques''
% \citep[p.~8]{IEEE2021c}. For example, ``the test coverage items derived by
% applying equivalence partitioning can be used to identify the input parameters
% of test cases derived for scenario testing'' \citetext{p.~8}.
These categories are not consistently defined so some approaches are
categorized differently by different sources; we track these differences so we
can analyze them more systematically. % \thesisissuetodo{21}

\phantomsection{}\label{multiCats}
\ifnotpaper
    % \clearpage
    \begin{wraptable}{r}{6cm}
        \vspace{-1.3cm}
        \input{build/multiCatTable}
        \vspace{-1cm}
    \end{wraptable}
\fi
In particular, \multiCatIntro{}. We identified \multiCatCount{} such cases
\ifnotpaper that we summarize in \Cref{tab:multiCatTable} \fi and list
\ifnotpaper \else the most prominent \fi along with their sources in
\Cref{tab:multiCats}\ifnotpaper\ for completeness\fi.
Most of these flaws (\multiCatMaxCount{}) involve the category of ``test
\multiCatMax{}'', which may simply be because authors use
this term more generally to mean ``test approach''.%
% (where we would use the term ``test approach'').
\phantomsection{}\label{cats-intrans} A more
specific reason for this is how the line between ``test technique'' and
``test practice'' can blur when these categories are \emph{not}
transitive. For example, ``some test practices, such as exploratory testing or
model-based testing are sometimes [incorrectly] referred to as `test techniques'
\dots{} as they are not themselves providing a way to create test cases, but
instead use test design techniques to achieve that'' \ifnotpaper
    (\citealp[p.~11]{IEEE2022}; \citeyear[p.~5]{IEEE2021a})\else
    \cite[p.~11]{IEEE2022}, \cite[p.~5]{IEEE2021a}\fi. This seems to be the
case for the following approaches:
% , which may explain these apparent ``flaws'':
\begin{itemize}
    \item Exploratory testing \ifnotpaper (\citeyear[p.~33]{IEEE2022};
              \citeyear[p.~viii]{IEEE2021c}; \citeyear[p.~13]{IEEE2013}) \else
              \cite[p.~33]{IEEE2022}, \cite[p.~viii]{IEEE2021c},
              \cite[p.~13]{IEEE2013} \fi
    \item Experience-based testing \ifnotpaper (\citeyear[p.~4]{IEEE2022};
              \citeyear[pp.~viii, 4]{IEEE2021c}; \citeyear[p.~33]{IEEE2013})
          \else \cite[p.~4]{IEEE2022}, \cite[pp.~viii, 4]{IEEE2021c},
              \cite[p.~33]{IEEE2013} \fi
    \item Scripted testing \citeyearpar[p.~33]{IEEE2022} \ifnotpaper
    \item Ad hoc testing (\citealp[p.~5\=/14]{SWEBOK2025}; \citealpISTQB{};
          \citealp[p.~42]{Kam2008})
    \item Model-based testing (\citealp[pp.~1\==2]{EngströmAndPetersen2015};
          \citealp[p.~4]{Kam2008}) \fi
\end{itemize}

\ifnotpaper
    As described in \Cref{infers}, we infer that child approaches inherit their
    parents' categories. However, there seem to be exceptions to this, which
    may indicate that categories are \emph{not} transitive or that they are
    \emph{except} in certain cases. For example, the practice of experience-based
    testing has many subtechniques, as described above, but it \emph{also} has
    subpractices, including tours \citep[p.~34]{IEEE2022} and exploratory testing
    (although the latter is categorized inconsistently; see \Cref{tab:multiCats}
    and above discussion). Similarly, the conflicting categorizations of beta
    testing in \Cref{tab:multiCats} may propagate to its children closed beta
    testing and open beta testing. When we infer these flaws, we exclude them
    from \Cref{tab:multiCatTable,tab:multiCats} and instead include them in
    \Cref{tab:infMultiCats} for completeness.
\fi

\subsubsection{Synonym Relation Flaws}\label{syns}

While synonyms do not inherently signify a flaw (as we discuss in
\Cref{syn-rels}), the software testing literature is full of incorrect and
ambiguous synonyms that do. As described in \Cref{relevantSyns}, we pay
special attention to synonyms between independently defined approaches (which
may be flaws) and to intransitive synonyms (which definitely \emph{are} flaws).
\ifnotpaper We present explicit (see \Cref{explicitness}) synonym relations that
    fit either of these criteria in \Cref{fig:expSynGraph}\utd{}, which we
    automatically generate from \ourApproachGlossary{} and manually modify for
    legibility. These relations are given as described by the literature and are
    therefore flawed. We provide the full list of synonyms that violate
    transitivity (along with their sources) in \Cref{multiSyns} and discuss
    other kinds of flawed synonym relations in \Cref{parSyns,scal-flaw,%
        compat-flaw,parSyns-full,infParSyns}.

    \end{figure}
    \clearpage
\fi

\subsubsection{Parent-Child Relation Flaws}\label{pars}
\phantomsection{}\label{selfPars}
Parent-child relations are also not immune to flaws. For example, some
approaches are given as parents of themselves, which violates the
irreflexivity of this relation as defined in \Cref{par-chd-rels}.
% Since these are by nature self-contained within a given source, we count these
% \emph{once} as objective flaws within
% their sources in \Cref{tab:flawMnfsts,tab:flawDmns}.
\ifnotpaper We identified
    the following \selfParCount{} examples through automatic analysis of our
    generated graphs (see \Cref{auto-flaw-detect}):
    \input{build/selfPars} Interestingly, \citet{Gerrard2000a,Gerrard2000b}
    does \emph{not} give performance testing as a subapproach of usability
    testing, which would have been more meaningful information to include.
\else For example, performance and usability testing are both
    given as subapproaches of themselves \cite[Tab.~2]{Gerrard2000a},
    \cite[Tab.~1]{Gerrard2000b}.\fi

flaw in \Cref{infParSyns} for completeness%

\phantomsection{}\label{path-exh-syns}
Of particular note is the relation between path testing and exhaustive testing.
While \citet[p.~421]{vanVliet2000} claims that path testing done completely
``is equivalent to exhaustively testing the program''\ifnotpaper\footnote{The
        contradictory definitions of path testing given in \flawref{path-test}
        add another layer of complexity to this claim.}\fi, this overlooks the
effects of input data \ifnotpaper
    (\citealp[pp.~129\==130]{IEEE2021c}; \citealp[p.~121]{Patton2006};

%     \subsubsection{Definition Flaws}\label{defs}

%     \citet{IEEE2022, IEEE2021a, IEEE2021b, IEEE2021c}, from the
%     ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 family of standards, mention the following 28 test
%     approaches without defining them. This means that out of the 119 test
%     approaches they mention, more than 20\% have no associated definition!

%     However, the previous version of this standard, \citeyearpar{IEEE2013},
%     generally explained two, provided references for two, and explicitly defined
%     one of these terms, for a total of five definitions that could (should) have
%     been included in \citeyearpar{IEEE2022}! These terms have been
%     \underline{underlined}\ifnotpaper%
%         , \emph{italicized}, and \textbf{bolded}, respectively%
%     \fi. Additionally, entries marked with an asterisk* were defined (at least
%     partially) in \citeyearpar{IEEE2017}, which would have been available when
%     creating this family of standards. These terms bring the total count of
%     terms that could (should) have been defined to eleven; almost 40\% of
%     these undefined test approaches could have been defined!

\subsection{Flaws by Subset}\label{flawSubsets}

Some ``subsets'' of the software testing literature contain interconnected
flaws. We describe them here, along with relevant data (e.g., definitions) that
are not necessarily flawed. We use the key-pairs for each flaw (as described in
\Cref{flaw-def}) to denote the actual flaws in these subsets; for example,
\texttt{(CONTRA, SYNS)} denotes a contradictory synonym. We highlight the
subsets of \ifnotpaper operational (acceptance) testing (\Cref{oat-flaw}), \fi
recovery testing (\Cref{recov-flaw}), scalability testing (\Cref{scal-flaw}),
and compatibility testing (\Cref{compat-flaw}).

    There are two names that the literature gives to this test approach:
    \begin{itemize}

\subsubsection{Recovery Testing}\label{recov-flaw}

``Recovery testing'' is ``testing \dots\ aimed at verifying
software restart capabilities after a system crash or other disaster''
\citep[p.~5\=/9]{SWEBOK2025} including ``recover[ing] the data directly affected
and re-establish[ing] the desired state of the system'' \citep{ISO_IEC2023a}
so that the system ``can perform required functions'' \citep[p.~370]{IEEE2017}.
However, the literature also describes similar test approaches with vague or
non-existent distinctions between them. We describe these approaches and their
flaws here\ifnotpaper\ and present the relations between them in
    \Cref{fig:rec-graph-current}\fi.

          and ``re-establish the desired state of the system''
          \citeyearpar{ISO_IEC2023a}. \refHelper \citet[p.~47]{Kam2008}
          gives this as a synonym for ``recovery testing''.
    \item \emph{Disaster/recovery testing} evaluates if a system
          can ``return to normal operation after a hardware
          or software failure'' \citep[p.~140]{IEEE2017} or if ``operation of
          the test item can be transferred to a different operating site and
          \dots\ be transferred back again once the failure has been
          resolved'' \citeyearpar[p.~37]{IEEE2021c}.

                    These two definitions seem to describe different aspects of
                    the system, where the first is intrinsic to the
                    hardware/software and the second might not be, making this
                    term nonatomic.

    \item \emph{Backup and recovery testing} ``measures the
          degree to which system state can be restored from backup within
          specified parameters of time, cost, completeness, and accuracy in
          the event of failure'' \citep[p.~2]{IEEE2013}. This may be what is
          meant by ``recovery testing'' in the context of performance-related
          testing \citeyearpar[Fig.~2]{IEEE2022}.
    \item \emph{Backup/recovery testing} determines the ability of a system
          ``to restor[e] from back-up memory in the event of failure, without
          transfer[ing] to a different operating site or back-up system''
          \citep[p.~37]{IEEE2021c}.

                    Its name is also quite similar to ``backup and
                    recovery testing'', adding further confusion.
          \end{itemize}
    \item \emph{Failover/recovery testing} determines the
          ability ``to mov[e] to a back-up system in the event of failure,
          without transfer[ing] to a different operating site''
          \citep[p.~37]{IEEE2021c}.

                    While not explicitly related to recovery, \emph{failover
                        testing} ``validates the SUT's ability to manage heavy
                    loads or unexpected failure to continue typical operations

                    are assumed by a secondary system'' \citepISTQB{}. Its name
                    implies that it is a child of ``failover/recovery testing''
                    but its definition makes it more broad (as it includes handling
                    ``heavy loads'' where failover/recovery testing does not)
                    which may reverse the direction of this relation.

                    \refHelper \citet[p.~56]{Firesmith2015} uses the term
                    ``failover and recovery testing'' which may be a synonym of

\citeauthor{IEEE2021c} \citeyearpar[p.~39]{IEEE2021c} give
``scalability testing'' as a synonym of ``capacity testing''
while other sources differentiate between the two \ifnotpaper

\else \cite[p.~53]{Firesmith2015}, \cite[pp.~22\==23]{Bas2024}\fi.

% Flaw count (CONTRA, DEFS): {IEEE2021c} | implied by {ISO_IEC2023a}
\citeauthor{IEEE2021c} \citeyearpar[p.~39]{IEEE2021c} also include the external
modification of the system as part of ``scalability'' but
\citet{ISO_IEC2023a} \multiAuthHelper{describe} it as testing the ``capability
of a product to handle growing or shrinking workloads or to adapt its capacity
to handle variability'', implying that this is done by the system itself.

% \subsubsection{Performance Testing}\label{perf-test-ambiguity}

% Similarly, ``performance'' and ``performance efficiency'' are both given as
% software qualities by \ifnotpaper\citeauthor{IEEE2017}\else
%       \cite[p.~319]{IEEE2017}\fi, with the latter defined as the ``performance
% relative to the amount of resources used under stated conditions''
% \ifnotpaper\citeyearpar[p.~319]{IEEE2017} \fi or the ``capability of a product
% to perform its functions within specified time and throughput parameters and be
% efficient in the use of resources under specified conditions'' \citep{ISO_IEC2023a}.
% Initially, there didn't seem to be any meaningful distinction between the two,
% although the term ``performance testing'' is defined
% \ifnotpaper\citeyearpar[p.~320]{IEEE2017}\else\citetext{p.~320}\fi\
% and used by \ifnotpaper\citeauthor{IEEE2017}\else\cite{IEEE2017}\fi\ and the term
% ``performance efficiency testing'' is \emph{also} used by
% \ifnotpaper\citeauthor{IEEE2017}\else\cite{IEEE2017}\fi\ (but not defined
% explicitly). \ifnotpaper Further discussion\thesisissuetodo{43} brought us to
%       the conclusion \else It can then be concluded \fi that ``performance
% efficiency testing'' is a subset of ``performance testing'', and the
% difference of ``relative to the amount of resources used'' or ``be efficient in
% the use of resources'' between the two is meaningful.

\subsubsection{Compatibility Testing}\label{compat-flaw}

\paragraph{\texttt{(OVER, DEFS)}}
% Flaw count (OVER, DEFS): {IEEE2022} | {IEEE2017} ISTQB {ISO_IEC2023a}
``Compatibility testing'' is defined as ``testing that measures the
degree to which a test item can function satisfactorily alongside
other independent products in a shared environment (co-existence),
and where necessary, exchanges information with other systems or
components (interoperability)'' \citep[p.~3]{IEEE2022}. This
definition is nonatomic as it combines the ideas of ``co-existence''
and ``interoperability''.

\paragraph{\texttt{(WRONG, SYNS)}}
% Flaw count (WRONG, SYNS): implied by {IEEE2021c} | {IEEE2022}
The ``interoperability'' element of ``compatibility testing'' is explicitly
excluded by \citet[p.~37]{IEEE2021c}, (incorrectly) implying that ``compatibility
testing'' and ``co-existence testing'' are synonyms.

\paragraph{\texttt{(AMBI, SYNS)}}
% Flaw count (AMBI, SYNS): {Kam2008} | {IEEE2022}
Furthermore, the definition of ``compatibility testing'' in
\citet[p.~43]{Kam2008} unhelpfully says ``see \emph{interoperability testing}'',
adding another layer of confusion to the direction of their relationship.

\paragraph{\texttt{(WRONG, LABELS)}}

``interoperability testing helps confirm that applications can work on multiple
operating systems and devices'', but this seems to instead describe
``portability testing'', which evaluates the ``capability of a product to be
adapted to changes in its requirements, contexts of use, or system environment''
